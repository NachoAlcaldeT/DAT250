# DAT250 Project Summary

This project focuses on exploring RabbitMQ, a powerful message broker that facilitates communication between distributed systems. Throughout the project, I conducted various experiments to understand how to set up, use, and troubleshoot RabbitMQ effectively. Below is a summary of each experiment, along with links to their detailed reports.

## Experiment 1: Installation of RabbitMQ

In the first experiment, I successfully installed RabbitMQ using Docker. The process was straightforward, and I accessed the management interface to monitor the server's performance.

## Experiment 2: Hello World

In this experiment, I completed the "Hello World" tutorial, implementing a simple producer-consumer model using RabbitMQ. The producer sends messages to a queue, and the consumer receives and processes them. This experiment helped me understand the basic functionalities of RabbitMQ.

## Experiment 3: Work Queues

The third experiment involved completing the "Work Queues" tutorial, where I implemented a system that distributes tasks among multiple workers. This setup demonstrated RabbitMQ's capabilities for load balancing and task management through the competing consumer pattern.

## Experiment 4: Topics

In the fourth experiment, I completed the "Publish/Subscribe" tutorial. This experiment introduced me to topics and routing patterns, allowing for more complex messaging scenarios where messages are sent to multiple consumers based on routing keys.

## Conclusion

Overall, the project provided valuable insights into using RabbitMQ for messaging applications. Each experiment contributed to a deeper understanding of RabbitMQ's functionalities and how to implement them effectively in real-world scenarios.
