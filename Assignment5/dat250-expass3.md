# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 5

### Technical Issues Encountered During the Installation and Use of MongoDB and How I Resolved Them

During the installation of MongoDB, I encountered a few technical problems related to package validation and running the `mongod` service.

1. **Package Validation**:
   - **Issue**: The PGP validation of the installation package failed due to an error with the downloaded public key.
   - **Solution**: I reviewed the validation process step by step from the official documentation and re-downloaded the public key following the instructions. Once the package was successfully validated, I proceeded with the installation.

2. **Running the `mongod` Server**:
   - **Issue**: After the installation, when trying to run `mongod`, the server instance did not start properly.
   - **Solution**: I identified that the service wasn't running because it was not enabled to start as a Windows service. I manually started the server from the terminal and added MongoDB to the `PATH` environment variable to facilitate command execution.

### Successful Package Validation

The package validation was successful using the instructions from the following link: [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/).

## Bulk Write Operations
Several bulk write operations were carried out to insert, update, and delete multiple documents efficiently. The screenshots show the process and results of these operations:

### Example of Experiment 2 Running (Map-Reduce)

#### **Map-Reduce Operation**
For the Map-Reduce experiment, I created a collection of transactions and applied a count by transaction type. The following code was used:

javascript
var mapFunction = function() {
   emit(this.type, 1);
};

var reduceFunction = function(key, values) {
   return Array.sum(values);
};

db.transactions.mapReduce(mapFunction, reduceFunction, { out: "transaction_count" })
This code maps the type field of each transaction document and reduces it by summing the values to get a total count for each transaction type.

![Screenshot of Map-Reduce operation](https://github.com/NachoAlcaldeT/DAT250/blob/main/Assignment5/Screenshots_Assignment5/captura2-exp2.png)

#### **Additional Map-Reduce Operation**
I developed an additional operation to calculate the total amount of transactions by type. The operation was as follows:

var mapFunction = function() {
   emit(this.type, this.amount);
};

var reduceFunction = function(key, values) {
   return Array.sum(values);
};

db.transactions.mapReduce(mapFunction, reduceFunction, { out: "total_amount_by_type" })

This Map-Reduce operation is useful for analyzing the total amounts for each transaction type, which is relevant for financial statistics or audit reports.

### Interpretation of the Obtained Collection

The implemented Map-Reduce operation is useful because it provides an efficient way to group and sum amounts based on user-defined categoriesâ€”in this case, the transaction types. This allows for the easy extraction of aggregated information, which would be much more computationally expensive if done through individual queries or manual data processing.

### Outstanding Issues with the Assignment

I encountered no significant unresolved issues. All steps, both installation and operation, were successfully completed.

### Conclusion

Through this experiment, I gained practical experience using MongoDB to perform basic CRUD operations and apply the Map-Reduce technique for data aggregation. Despite the initial technical problems, they were successfully resolved, allowing the assignment to be completed satisfactorily.
